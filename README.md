# Factors-Influencing-Employee-s-Performance
Tim Horton has data collected from 2012 containing reviews by current and former employees. They want to understand more about the data they have but they don’t know what value they can derive from it. The objective is to garner business value from the given information and pose the findings to the client. Understanding an individual employee's behaviour can help to develop those methodologies that matter to the business. In this project, the meaningful review segmentations are derived. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to interpret the employee’s comments. We explore those features that affect employees comment especially former employees. The idea behind it is the high ranking group are not problematic and does not give significant business idea while those employees that have some complains can be studied. The reasons of low rating could be categorized by their feature importance and the client could focus on solutions and decision makings by those key factors.
